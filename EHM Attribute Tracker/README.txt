############### KENDALF'S ATTRIBUTE TRACKER ###############



Hi everyone,

Interactive tutorials are available inside the Tracker. However, the setup for the Attribute Tracker is a little convoluted (requiring you to open different programs, and save certain files, and paste certain ways). If anyone has a simpler solution to getting the data into the rawData sheet (or if you have any questions or suggestions), please send me an email at kendalf.kodes@gmail.com (reddit: kendalf_the_pale), and I'll update the tool. 

Thanks,
